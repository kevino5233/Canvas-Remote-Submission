This is a small project I made so that people could submit assignments remotely using the Canvas LMS. It utilizes the Canvas API, a Java JSON library, and Java's built in HTTP library.

In order to use this project, you will need to obtain an Oauth key and paste it into a file named "oauth.txt". You can obtain a key if you have access to Canvas. Go to settings and scroll down to the bottom of the page. It will ask you for a purpose but should give you the key immediately after you fill one out (it did for me).
